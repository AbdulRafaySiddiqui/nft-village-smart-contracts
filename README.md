### Branching guide

- stable (stable production code, without any test or scripts in the branch)
- main (development here)
- dev (only test here)

**_main_** is only for development of contracts, then it is merged in **_dev_** and contracts are tested there, if test are working fine, **_dev_** is merged in the **_stable_** branch
